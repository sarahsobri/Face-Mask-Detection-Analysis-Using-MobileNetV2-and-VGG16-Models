# Face-Mask-Detection-Analysis-Using-MobileNetV2-and-VGG16-Models
#### Ever since the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, face masks have been adopted globally as an essential daily infection control tool to prevent cross-contamination. Unfortunately, not many people are adhering to the regulations, hastening the transmission of the virus from one person to another. Thus, we propose a method for preventing this transmission of the virus by detecting and monitoring those who are not following the guidelines and reporting them to the appropriate authorities. This motivates us to investigate face mask detection technologies to monitor the community in public places. For this project, we have successfully implemented deep learning (DL) to assure effective real-time facemask identification to address the challenge of face mask recognition in photos. We have considered the use of MobileNetV2 and VGG16 that leverage transfer learning from ImageNet. Furthermore, we have also integrated the use of OpenCV to perform continuous facial recognition from our webcam.
